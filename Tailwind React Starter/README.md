# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# INFO (How I Started from scratch)

1- Go to https://tailwindcss.com/
2- docs
3- Framework guides
4- Vite

npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react   (instead of my-project we did ./ to install it in the same file)

the rest of steps same like they are...

to customize some features take from (Tailwind React Starter) file  (index.css, tailwind.config.js, files structure )
